### Hey There! I am Aayush Garg.

I am currently a high school student studying at Amity International School, Sector 46 Gurgaon. 

I am interested in Web Development and App Development. I am also keenly interested in how systems interact and how they are scalable and redundant. I primarily work with Node.js and its libraries such as React, Express, Vue etc.
